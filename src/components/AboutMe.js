      <p className="aboutMe__text">
        I'm a junior front-end developer with a broad background in video
        editing and post-production. For 4 years I was working in a small
        audiovisual production company, taking care of the editing and
        post-production of each piece, knowing how to adapt to tight times and
        all kinds of clients. Even though it was not the IT world, it was also a
        continuous movement where I knew how to adapt by learning other
        technologies such as 4D design and motion graphics.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className="aboutMe__text">
        I consider myself a person with great adaptation to the needs of each
        project. In addition, having worked as a freelancer has been very
        rewarding. I have been able to work on projects that I was passionate
        about and where I had more freedom to apply the creativity that
        characterizes me.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className="aboutMe__text">
        For me, everything related to design and art is a world that I am
        passionate about.

      <p className="aboutMe__text">
        In my free time I like to do analog photography, just as a hobby, my
        "devil" side is finding the best taverns and bars to eat and drink in
        Madrid. Have I already mentioned that I have also been a waitress?{" "}
      </p>
      <p className="aboutMe__text">
        I decided to take a slight turn in my direction to bet on web
        development because if there is something that I have always been clear
        about, it is that I want to work with a computer and that, along with my
        abilities and skills in terms of art, having been curious and
        self-taught and the great adaptability to new technologies, could bring
        my potential to its maximum in web development.
